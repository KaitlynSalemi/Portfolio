# Kaitlyn Salemi's Web Development Portfolio

This website was built to let you learn about me as a Web Developer. 

## Built With:

- Adobe Xd
- HTML/CSS
- Sass
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- Node
- Express
- Nodemailer
- MailGun
- Azure App Services
- Environment Variables
- Google Domains

# Features

This website features a minimalist design that is easy to navigate and won't fatigue the eyes. The layout was created with CSS Grid and looks great on any screen size. There are small animations throughout the site that were created with CSS animations. 

The project section shows my top three projects. The section provides a quick summary of each project and where you can learn more about them. 

The resumes section shows of all my hard skills and a place to download my full Web Developer resume. 

The contact form is where you, the visitor, can get in touch. The form features Javascript form validation and clears the form when your message has been sent. The message from the visitor is sent right to my mailbox by the power of Nodemailer and MailGun. 

At the bottom is where you can find my email, Github, and LinkedIn.

# Future

In the future I will be updating the project section the most. Please check back often to see what new things I have created.
